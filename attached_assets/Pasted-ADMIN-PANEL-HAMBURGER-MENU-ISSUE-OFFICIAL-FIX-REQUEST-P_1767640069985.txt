ADMIN PANEL HAMBURGER MENU ISSUE – OFFICIAL FIX REQUEST
❌ Problem Description (Admin Panel)

In the Admin Panel, when clicking the hamburger (☰) menu:

Only some admin pages are visible

Remaining menu items are hidden / cut off

Scrolling does not reveal all pages

Issue occurs mainly on:

Mobile devices

Small height screens

Zoomed desktop views

This prevents admins from accessing all panel pages.

🔍 Root Cause (Technical)

The issue is caused by CSS layout constraints, such as:

Sidebar or hamburger container using fixed height

overflow: hidden applied to menu or parent container

Sidebar wrapped inside another fixed or absolute positioned container

Missing vertical scrolling (overflow-y not enabled)

As a result, menu items overflow outside the viewport and become inaccessible.

✅ Strict Fix Requirements (VERY IMPORTANT)

⚠️ DO NOT:

Change any existing UI design

Change colors, spacing, fonts, icons

Change page structure or HTML layout

Change routing, permissions, or logic

Remove or rename any menu items

✔ ONLY:

Fix hamburger/sidebar menu so ALL admin pages are visible

Enable proper vertical scrolling inside the menu

Keep everything else exactly the same

✅ Correct Expected Behavior

Hamburger menu must show ALL admin pages

Menu must scroll vertically if items exceed screen height

Works on:

Mobile

Tablet

Desktop

Applies only to hamburger/sidebar behavior

No UI or logic changes

✅ Required Technical Fix (CSS-ONLY PREFERRED)

Ensure the admin sidebar / hamburger container uses:

height: 100vh;
overflow-y: auto;
overflow-x: hidden;
-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;

❌ Must remove / avoid:
overflow: hidden;
max-height: 100vh;
fixed height values;

✅ Layout Rule (IMPORTANT)

Sidebar must NOT be wrapped inside any container with:

Fixed height

overflow: hidden

Sidebar should control its own vertical scroll

✅ JavaScript Rule (If Toggle Exists)

If a JS toggle is used for the hamburger:

It must only open/close the sidebar

It must NOT block sidebar scrolling

overflow: hidden should never be applied to the sidebar itself

🧪 Testing Checklist (Must Pass)

✔ Admin panel on mobile
✔ Long admin menu (many pages)
✔ Scroll works fully
✔ No visual change
✔ No logic break
✔ No routing issues

🧠 FINAL COPY-PASTE PROMPT (ADMIN PANEL)

Fix the hamburger/sidebar menu issue in the Admin Panel where not all admin pages are visible.
The problem is caused by fixed height and missing vertical scrolling in the sidebar or its parent containers.
Enable proper vertical scrolling using height: 100vh and overflow-y: auto so all menu items are accessible.
Do NOT change any existing UI design, layout, colors, icons, or business logic.
Only fix the hamburger menu behavior to ensure all admin pages are visible and scrollable on all screen sizes.
