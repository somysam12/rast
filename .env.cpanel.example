# SilentMultiPanel - cPanel Environment Configuration
# This is an EXAMPLE file showing the variables you need to set

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=silentmu_silentdb
DB_USER=silentmu_silentdb
DB_PASS=844121@luvkush

# These are already hardcoded in config/database.php as defaults
# But you can set these as environment variables for extra security
# 
# METHOD 1: Using .htaccess (in your root folder)
# Add these lines to .htaccess:
#
# SetEnv DB_HOST localhost
# SetEnv DB_NAME silentmu_silentdb
# SetEnv DB_USER silentmu_silentdb
# SetEnv DB_PASS 844121@luvkush
#
# METHOD 2: Using cPanel's "Manage Environment Variables" (if available)
# Set the same variables there
#
# METHOD 3: No action needed
# The config/database.php file has hardcoded defaults that will work
# automatically without any environment configuration
